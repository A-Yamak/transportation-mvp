# Today's Accomplishments - 2026-01-04

This folder tracks what each developer has completed today.

## Structure

```
todays-accomplishments/
├── dev1/  - Developer 1: Financial Core (Ledger System)
├── dev2/  - Developer 2: Revenue Management (Pricing)
└── dev3/  - Developer 3: Integrations & Operations
```

## How to Use

Each developer should:

1. **As you complete files**, add them to your folder:
   - Copy completed migrations to your folder
   - Copy completed models to your folder
   - Copy completed services to your folder
   - Copy completed tests to your folder

2. **Create a completion log** (`COMPLETED.md`) listing:
   - [x] Files created
   - [x] Tests written
   - [x] Test results (all passing)
   - [x] Any notes or blockers

3. **End of day**: Project lead reviews each folder to verify completion

## Example

```
dev1/
├── COMPLETED.md (checklist of what's done)
├── migrations/ (copies of created migrations)
├── models/ (copies of created models)
├── services/ (copies of created services)
└── tests/ (copies of test files)
```

## Why This Helps

- **Visibility**: See exactly what each dev accomplished
- **Quality Control**: Easy to review before merging
- **Documentation**: Track daily progress
- **Learning**: Other devs can see implementation approaches
- **Backup**: Safety net before pushing to main branch
